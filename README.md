# The-Unity-Bridge-Foundation
 Our mission is to foster family-like relationships and dynamics between kids 5-13 years of age. We provide fun opportunities for kids who have family members with disabilities or chronic illnesses, making it possible for these kids to find these opportunities and create connections with other youth in the same situation.
